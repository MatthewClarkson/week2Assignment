           <h4>Living in a rural town deep in the hills of West Virginia definetely has its disadvantages but for alot of Mountaineers it holds a place deep in their heart that they cherish every day. On the other end of the spectrum some leave the appalachian way of life for a more fast paced urban setting. </h4>     <!--img tags with absolute url's and alt for errors and screen readers-->

             <p>Spencer is located in west central West Virginia and offers residents a very light suburban atmosphere and most residents rent their homes. Living in Spencer offers a distinctive experience. The small town setting and friendly people make it a wonderful place to call home.The cost of living is very reasonable in the region and larger metropolitan areas are a short drive away. This makes it easy to find culture and entertainment outside of the small town.</p>

             <p>Median household income and home value is well below the national average. The unemployment rate is almost double the national average and recent job growth is negative, down by one half percent. Population has declined by over twenty percent over the last three years. Despite all this, the rural community prefer to be away from the commotion of big city life. Many natives who move away feel a deep sense of home and find their way back to the small town. </p>

             <p>Spencer used to be home to a hospital for mentally impaired. It stretched more than a quater mile on a hill that Walmart now occupies. The hospital was demolished in the late 1980's. At the time it was built it was considered the longest brick building in the country.</p>
